An academic event is a planned process
  to which a certain set of people or organizations contribute 
    by realizing their diffenrent academic event roles according to some kind of plan
      which is concretized by certain objective, action and condition specifications
        that facilitate various kinds of human communication processes 
          in which the participants have the opportunity 
            - to present and discuss or learn about certain research results and related facts and
            - to maintain old or build new personal and professional relationships with other attendees of the academic event.
          
The roles inhering in the contributors of an academic event are distinguised by certain dispositions and capabilities of the contributors. These dispositions and capabilities are in turn specified or concretized by certain generically dependend continuants.
